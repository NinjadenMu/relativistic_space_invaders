# Relativistic Space Invaders
Relativistic Space Invaders is a spin-off of the classic space invaders game (and my AP Physics C final project).  However, the player controls a ship capable of speeds up to an eyewatering 0.9c, so the effects of special relativity can be observed.  The relativistic effects are rendered by treating the player's ship as a stationary observer with everything else moving relative to it.  Lorentz time dilation and length contraction follow the exact mathematical models a real world object would.

In addition to realistic relativistic effects, the player controlled spaceship also obeys Newton's laws and basic kinematics.  Unlike the original Space Invaders, the player can't instantly start and stop.  Instead, momentum is conserved and the player must slowly accelerate to their max speed.
